# PrimeDropEnchant

PrimeDropEnchant allows players to transfer enchantments from items to 
books and vice versa. It's as simple as taking a book, and right clicking it
onto an enchanted item. The player will be able to select which enchantments
they would like to keep or drop from an itemstack and into a new book.

**Restrictions:**
- Players can only transfer to/from books (will be configurable in the future)
- Players can only transfer enchants from a single item (not a stack of swords)
- Players can only transfer to a single book
- Players CAN bulk enchant from a stack of books, but only to ONE item at a time
